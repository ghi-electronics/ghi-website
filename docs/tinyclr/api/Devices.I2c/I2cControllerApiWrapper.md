# I2cControllerApiWrapper Class

**NuGet:** `GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.I2c`<br/>**Assembly:** `GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.I2c`<br/>**Namespace:** `GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.I2c.Provider`

Concrete `II2cControllerProvider` backed by the native TinyCLR I²C HAL.

```csharp
public sealed class I2cControllerApiWrapper : II2cControllerProvider
```

## Constructors

### I2cControllerApiWrapper(NativeApi api)

```csharp
public I2cControllerApiWrapper(NativeApi api)
```

Wraps the given native API as a provider.

## Properties

### Api

```csharp
public NativeApi Api { get; }
```

The underlying native API descriptor.

### WriteBufferSize

```csharp
public extern int WriteBufferSize { get; set; }
```

Slave-mode only: size in bytes of the controller's outgoing buffer. _(inherited)_

### ReadBufferSize

```csharp
public extern int ReadBufferSize { get; set; }
```

Slave-mode only: size in bytes of the controller's incoming buffer. _(inherited)_

### BytesToWrite

```csharp
public extern int BytesToWrite { get; }
```

Slave-mode only: bytes currently queued to transmit. _(inherited)_

### BytesToRead

```csharp
public extern int BytesToRead { get; }
```

Slave-mode only: bytes currently available to read. _(inherited)_

### Timeout

```csharp
public TimeSpan Timeout { get; set; }
```

Maximum time the controller will block on a single transfer. _(inherited)_

## Methods

### Dispose()

```csharp
public void Dispose()
```

Releases the native controller.

### SetActiveSettings(I2cConnectionSettings connectionSettings)

```csharp
public extern void SetActiveSettings(I2cConnectionSettings connectionSettings)
```

Applies the given settings before the next transfer. _(inherited)_

### WriteRead(byte[] writeBuffer, int writeOffset, int writeLength, byte[] readBuffer, int readOffset, int readLength, out int written, out int read)

```csharp
public extern I2cTransferStatus WriteRead(byte[] writeBuffer, int writeOffset, int writeLength, byte[] readBuffer, int readOffset, int readLength, out int written, out int read)
```

Performs a write-then-read transaction. _(inherited)_

**Returns** `I2cTransferStatus`

### ClearWriteBuffer()

```csharp
public extern void ClearWriteBuffer()
```

Slave-mode only: empties the controller's outgoing buffer. _(inherited)_

### ClearReadBuffer()

```csharp
public extern void ClearReadBuffer()
```

Slave-mode only: empties the controller's incoming buffer. _(inherited)_

## Events

### FrameReceived

```csharp
public event FrameReceivedEventHandler FrameReceived
```

Slave-mode only: raised when a master frame addressed to this slave is observed. _(inherited)_

### ErrorReceived

```csharp
public event ErrorReceivedEventHandler ErrorReceived
```

Slave-mode only: raised when the controller detects a bus error. _(inherited)_
