# SocketOptionName Enum

**NuGet:** `GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Networking`<br/>**Assembly:** `GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Networking`<br/>**Namespace:** `System.Net.Sockets`

Defines socket option names for the class.

```csharp
public enum SocketOptionName
```

## Fields

| Name | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Debug` | `0x0001` | Record debugging information. |
| `AcceptConnection` | `0x0002` | Socket is listening. |
| `ReuseAddress` | `0x0004` | Allows the socket to be bound to an address that is already in use. |
| `KeepAlive` | `0x0008` | Send keep-alives. |
| `DontRoute` | `0x0010` | Do not route, send directly to interface addresses. |
| `Broadcast` | `0x0020` | Permit sending broadcast messages on the socket. |
| `UseLoopback` | `0x0040` | Bypass hardware when possible. |
| `Linger` | `0x0080` | Linger on close if unsent data is present. |
| `OutOfBandInline` | `0x0100` | Receives out-of-band data in the normal data stream. |
| `DontLinger` | `~Linger` | Close socket gracefully without lingering. |
| `ExclusiveAddressUse` | `~ReuseAddress` | Enables a socket to be bound for exclusive access. |
| `SendBuffer` | `0x1001` | Specifies the total per-socket buffer space reserved for sends. This is unrelated to the maximum message size or the size of a TCP window. |
| `ReceiveBuffer` | `0x1002` | Send low water mark. |
| `SendLowWater` | `0x1003` | Specifies the total per-socket buffer space reserved for receives. This is unrelated to the maximum message size or the size of a TCP window. |
| `ReceiveLowWater` | `0x1004` | Receive low water mark. |
| `SendTimeout` | `0x1005` | Send timeout. |
| `ReceiveTimeout` | `0x1006` | Receive timeout. |
| `Error` | `0x1007` | Get error status and clear. |
| `Type` | `0x1008` | Get socket type. |
| `MaxConnections` | `0x7fffffff` | Maximum queue length that can be specified by . |
| `IPOptions` | `1` | IP options. |
| `HeaderIncluded` | `2` | Header is included with data. |
| `TypeOfService` | `3` | IP type of service and preced. |
| `IpTimeToLive` | `4` | IP time to live. |
| `MulticastInterface` | `9` | IP multicast interface. - Additional comments by mbolien: multicast interface You provide it with an SOCKADDR_IN, and that tells the system that it should receive multicast messages on that interface (if you have more than one interface). Binding the socket is not sufficient, since if the Ethernet hardware isnt set up to grab the multicast packets, it wont do good to bind the socket. Kinda like raw sockets. Unless you put the Ethernet card in promiscuous mode, youll only get stuff sent to and from your machine. |
| `MulticastTimeToLive` | `10` | IP multicast time to live. |
| `MulticastLoopback` | `11` | IP Multicast loopback. |
| `AddMembership` | `12` | Add an IP group membership. |
| `DropMembership` | `13` | Drop an IP group membership. |
| `DontFragment` | `14` | Don't fragment IP datagrams. |
| `AddSourceMembership` | `15` | Join IP group/source. |
| `DropSourceMembership` | `16` | Leave IP group/source. |
| `BlockSource` | `17` | Block IP group/source. |
| `UnblockSource` | `18` | Unblock IP group/source. |
| `PacketInformation` | `19` | Receive packet information for ipv4. |
| `HopLimit` | `21` | The IPv6 hop limit for outgoing packets. |
| `NoDelay` | `1` | Disables the Nagle algorithm for send coalescing. |
| `BsdUrgent` | `2` |  |
| `Expedited` | `2` | Sends data as expedited (urgent) data. |
| `NoChecksum` | `1` |  |
| `ChecksumCoverage` | `20` | Udp-Lite checksum coverage. |
| `UpdateAcceptContext` | `0x700B` | Updates the socket context after a call to accept a connection. |
| `UpdateConnectContext` | `0x7010` | Updates the socket context after a call to connect. |
